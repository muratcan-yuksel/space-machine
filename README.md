# instructions on how to customize

- I've divided the app into small components. Since you've told me you're not good with CSS, I've refrained from using dynamic styling.
- Each section is divided via a collection of images. Each one of them is a different component. Only thing you need to do is to add relevant images to each one of them. If you don't want a collection, you can just get rid of the component as a whole. I've put a second column in the collection components if you want to add more images on each one.
- The first image is generally a GIF that shows a collection of NFTs rapidly.
